Question D.

1.

BigTheta(x^2)

2.

BigTheta(log(x))

3.

BigTheta(n^2)

4.

BigTheta(min(N, M))

5.

BigTheta(n * log(n))

Proof:

We just need to show there exist K and M such that
|log_b^f(x)| < K * |log_10^f(x)| for any x > M
<=> |lgf(x)|/lg(b) < K * |lgf(x)| for any x > M
<=> K > 1/lg(b)
we take K = 2/lg(b) and any M
then we can get for any x > M
|log_b^f(x)|<|K * log_10^f(x)|

7.

Proof:

We need to show there exist K and M such that
log p(x) < K * log x for any x > M
We assume the highest degree term of p(x) is C * x^d
when x approaches infinite, x^d will dominate other lower degree terms
we assume there is a constant L and M, s.t. when x > M, p(x) < C * L * x^d
log p(x) < log (C * L * x^d)
<=> log p(x) < d * log x + log (C * L)
Then K > [log (C * L)/log x] + d,
K * log x > d * log x + log (C * L) > log p(x)
proved

ceil(f(n)) <= f(n) + 1 âˆˆ O(f(n) + 1) = O(f(n))
